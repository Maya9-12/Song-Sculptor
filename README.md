# Song Sculptor

Song Sculptor is a React single page application that allows users to obtain information about songs or artists using the Spotify Web API. I configured the application to run in both GitHub Codespace and Github Pages. Visit my github page here :
### https://maya9-12.github.io/Song-Sculptor/

or to run in Codespace or locally use:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
